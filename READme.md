What did you like about this project?
We had some help :D , it was highly challenging and allowed me to gain more hands on experience on creating class objects

What did you struggle with in this project?
creating classes, "this" and javascript in general. I doubt I can replicate this if not given the initial help

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
If I can I think I would like to have a slightly longer time allocated to javascript lessons as it is one
of the tougher programming language out there. eg : (Es5 => Es6 etc)
